Routes are basically used to keep the things separate and clean like we did in our project
i.e. we made one file for user work
and other for host work and one for server creation
We can write html in different files by makinga folder named: views
If a page exports more than one module then use : exports.name=name
TO ADD EJS
npm install --save ejs
